# Installation

To make the native application known to firefox run `./install`. It will create a json file with the correct path in `~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/`.

Then load the add-on via eg. `about:debugging`.

Note: `recoll-we` should probably not run at the same time.

## Prior work

The code have been re-purposed from [web-index](https://gitlab.com/hedning/web-index).
